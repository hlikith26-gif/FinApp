    <h1>Tips for giving more importance to needs:</h1>
    <h2>Food, transport, school/work items, health, bills — these always come before anything else.</h2>
    <h2>A need helps you live or function.
    A want just makes life more enjoyable.</h2>
    <h2>Skipping lunch for a game item or snack later isn’t worth it.</h2>
    <h2>If you must cut something, reduce or delay wants first.</h2>
